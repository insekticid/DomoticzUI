# DomoticzUI
Cross-platform app made in CoronaSDK for interfacing with Domoticz.
This app is designed to be a large interface running on a wall-mounted device. There are mobile phone applications available that offer more capability, if that is needed.

<br>Getting Started</br>

1. Download and install CoronaSDK
2. Modify global variables located in main.lua for your environment
    -Need to obtain an API key for weather underground
3. Launch CoronaSDK simulator, test the application, then compile for device.


<br>Future Additions</br>
1. Completely dynamic interface that allows moving boxes based on a snapgrid, adding new boxes, setting box types, box colors, custom REST api calls per on/off characteristics
2. Video streaming/refresh for camera polling
3. Floorplan overlay button with uploadable background image and allow for dynamically placed buttons/devices.


This code was quickly put together for a single purpose, but can be modified to fit someone else's environment if needed. It was just a lot quicker for me to hard-code aspects than adding a full-dynamic approach to something I will set and never change.
